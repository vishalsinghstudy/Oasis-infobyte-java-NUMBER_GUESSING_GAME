# Guessing Number Game

This Java program implements a simple game where the user has to guess a random number between 1 and 100 in 5 trials or less. The program gives hints to the user after each guess, indicating whether the number is greater or less than their guess. If the user is unable to guess the number within 5 trials, the program reveals the number.

# How to Play

1. Compile and run the Java program.

2. The program will select a random number between 1 and 100 and print  the following message:

```bash
   1 A number is selected between 1 to 100. Guess the number within 5 trials.
```

3. Enter your guess for the number.

4. The program will give you a hint, indicating whether the number is greater or less than your guess. For example:

```bash
   1 Guess the number :50
   2 The number is Greater then 50. Try Again!
```
5. Continue guessing until you either guess the number correctly or have used up all 5 trials.

6. If you guess the number correctly, the program will print a congratulations message. If you are unable to guess the number, the program will reveal the number.

# Compiling and Running

To compile the program, navigate to the directory containing the Java file and run the following command:

```bash
   1 javac Task2.java
```
To run the program, run the following command:
